# Flutter RPG Character Cards Learning Project

This repository contains a Flutter project aimed at learning how to create RPG character cards following NetNinja's Flutter Masterclass. This project is part of my personal learning.

The app will allow users to create, view, and manage RPG character cards. Each character card will contain details like the character's name, class, attributes, and abilities.

Note: Firebase configurations are not untracked.
